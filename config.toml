The important thing is what we learn from it.So, grab a coffee, take a deep breath, and listen to us talk about tech tales and fails with the most inspiring experts to ever show up on the whole internet."

He relishes sharing and learning and can be found doing both via Twitter and his blog. He spends most of his time looking at a screen and loves to solve problems. He knows that looking at a screen so much is bad for him because his wife tells him so. Thus, he is often out riding his bike as his eyes are not good enough to play cricket any more.
